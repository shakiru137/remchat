def like_post(data):
    """
    Handles the 'like_post' event when a user likes or unlikes a post.

    Args:
        data (dict): Contains the 'post_id' for the post the user interacts with.

    The function checks if the current user has already liked the post:
        - If yes, it unlikes the post and decrements the like count.
        - If no, it likes the post and increments the like count.

    Emits:
        - 'like_response': Sends a response back to the client with a success or error message.

    Raises:
        Exception: If any database operation fails.
